The currently released version of RIGS is `0.2.1'.

Noteworthy changes in Version 0.2.1
===================================
   * Modified initialization process when Ruby is invoked from
     within an GNUstep application C program.
   * Objective C structures are now handled as CStruct objects in
     Ruby instead of plain Ruby Array. Allow the redefinition of
     method NSRect size and NSRange length without overriding
     those from the native Array class
   * GSTable, GSVbox, GSHbox now imported with the Foundation 
     module in Ruby. (GNUstep specific classes)

     in the Examples directory
